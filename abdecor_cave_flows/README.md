Advanced Biome Decoration: Cave Flows
=====================================

This biome decoration places liquid sources in cave ceilings. The liquid placed is based on the climate of the biome; dry/hot biomes are more likely to have lava while cold/wet biomes are more likely to have water. These liquid flows are only placed in caves where there's ample vertical space, and the liquids will often flow and expand to cover large areas of a cave floor.
