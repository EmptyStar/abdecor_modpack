Advanced Biome Decoration: Boulders
===================================

This biome decoration places boulders throughout the landscape according to the climate of the registered biomes. Space around each boulder location is scanned to ensure there's enough space to place each boulder, and the layer below the surface is checked for flat ground.

Climates
--------

### Desert

Desert biomes are those that have a sandy top node or are named "desert" in some way. It's an imperfect check, but in practice, it works well enough to identify desert biomes. Boulders in this climate are made of desert stone.

### Dry

Dry biomes are those that have a humidity point below 40 and heat greater than 20. These are typically biomes such as savannas, plains, and similar dry biomes. Boulders in this climate are made from plain cobblestone.

### Temperate

Temperate biomes are those that are not either desert or dry. Most biomes are likely to be temperate. Boulders in this climate are made from a mix of plain cobblestone and mossy cobblestone with an occasional grass growth.
