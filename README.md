Advanced Biome Decoration Modpack
=================================

This modpack contains a collection of biome decorations implemented via the [Advanced Biome Decoration API](https://github.com/EmptyStar/abdecor). Each mod in this modpack adds some decoration that cannot be easily achieved or achieved at all with the normal Minetest biome decoration API.

In addition to the decorations they provide, the mods in this modpack serve as practical working examples of the kind of decorations that can be created with the Advanced Biome Decoration API.
