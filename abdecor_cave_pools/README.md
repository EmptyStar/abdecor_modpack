Advanced Biome Decoration: Cave Pools
=====================================

This biome decoration places pools of liquid throughout underground caves. The liquid placed is based on the climate of the biome; dry/hot biomes are more likely to have pools of lava while cold/wet biomes are more likely to have pools of water. These pools can be found in caves of any size or shape and they will always be fully contained within solid ground.
